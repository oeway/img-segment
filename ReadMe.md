# Python auxiliary toolbox for cell segmentation with Deep Learning

This Python code provides auxiliary functions to perform image segmentation. It
contains different modules to

* Convert image annotations to image masks.
* Convert image masks to polygon cooordinates. These coordinates can be stored in
different formats and be use in other applications.

These tool were specifically developed to be used with [**ImJoy**]()
and its [**A-net plugin**](), but can also be outside of this scope.

For a more detailed description for how to use these tools in the context of
cell segmentation, we refer to the [**A-net documentation])().
